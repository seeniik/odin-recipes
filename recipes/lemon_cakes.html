                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>2 cups sugar</li>
                <li>5 large eggs</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees, with rack in lowest position, and grease your cupcake pans.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl (or liquid measuring cup), combine buttermilk with lemon zest and juice.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
                <li>With an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
                <li>With mixer on low, add flour mixture in three parts alternately with the buttermilk mixture in two, beginning and ending with flour; beat just until smooth (do not overmix).</li>
                <li>Divide batter evenly between pans; smooth tops.</li>
                <li> Bake until a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, ~15 minutes (tent with foil if browning too quickly).</li>
                <li>Cool 15 minutes in pan. Turn out cakes onto a rack; cool completely before glazing.</li>
            </ol>
